#Swarm

##Overview
A Generative Design programming experiment using Perlin Noise as a function to achieve pseudo-random motion. This program is  maps the [Perlin Noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) space to the 2D movement of Swarm agents on a canvas. To manipulate the Swarm elements in real time, the controlP5 library by Andreas Schlegel is used. This program is obstinately an experiment that reaches fruition in [String Theory](https://github.com/Satre95/String-Theory), but I'd love to see where you can take it. 

##Requirements
* Processing 2.0 or above
* controlP5 Library by Andreas Schlegel, available [here](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/).
* processing.pdf if exporting to PDF.

##License
This project uses the [MIT License](https://github.com/Satre95/Swarm/blob/master/LICENSE).
